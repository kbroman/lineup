\title{Standardize the columns of a matrix}
\usage{
fscale(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same form as the input, but with columns transformed
to have mean 0 and SD 1.
}
\description{
Standardize each column in a matrix, so that the columns have mean 0 and SD
1.
}
\details{
Missing values (\code{NA}) are ignored and left as is.

If there is just 1 non-missing value in a column, it is left as is.

This function uses a one-pass algorithm to calculate the mean and SD, which
is fast but can show a bit of round-off error.
