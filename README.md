[R/lineup](https://github.com/kbroman/lineup) is an
[R](https://www.r-project.org) package with tools for detecting and
correcting sample mix-ups between two sets of measurements, such as
between gene expression data on two tissues.

This is particularly aimed at eQTL data for an experimental cross.
